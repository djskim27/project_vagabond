3.  DESCRIPTION: The main purpose of this application is to offer a channel to visit and explore different cities and/or metropolitan areas around the world and be able to post comments about different activities and experiences related to each city. This could become an effective and practical planning tool for potential visitors to these cities. Initially, just few cities have been included as part of the first release but the plan is to expand this to other cities.  When users enter the ROAMR application they will find a home page where they can login, select any of the cities from the list and create, edit, or delete a post in the application. New Users can hover around the app but are not able to create or update posts until they create a profile and login to the application.

Finally, a global map pinpoints the geographical position of each city using the latitude and longitude. This feature is available at the bottom part of the home page.  

4. NEXT VERSION FEATURES   the plan for version v2.0 is to include part or all of the following features:
•    See Users can see the list of the city pages they've contributed to, on their
         public profile
•    Users can see the number of posts they've written for each city, next to the
        city's name in their profile.

•    Click on a pin on the homepage map and be redirected to the corresponding
         city page.

# Dizzy's Blog
This is a personal blog that I created using Ruby on Rails and Active Admin/Devise. I've always wanted to create an application where there is an Admin who can control the contents of a page from behind the scenes. For this blog, a user can post a blog with an image from their desktop as well. Building this application was a very fun learning experience!
